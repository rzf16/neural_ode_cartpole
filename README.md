# Neural ODEs for Cartpole Dynamics
This repository contains the code for rzfeng's Robot Learning final project. It implements a simulated cartpole system, (eventually) predictive neural network and neural ODE dynamics models, and MPPI for swing-up control.

## Dependencies
The following Python3 packages are required:
```
torch
numpy
matplotlib
torchdiffeq
seaborn
pyyaml
```
All dependencies can be installed with `pip3 install <package>`.
